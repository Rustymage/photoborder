# Photo Border Thing

A small script to add a border to a jpeg or png photo.

Exif data can also be extracted and added to the border if the mood strikes.

A colour palette can be added to the border as well.

## Usage

```bash
usage: python border.py [-h] [-e] [-p] filename

Add a border and exif data to a jpg or png photo

positional arguments:
  filename

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e, --exif            print photo exif data on the border
  -p, --palette         Add colour palette to the photo border

Made for fun and to solve a little problem.
```
